# Chapter 2

They landed Cosmic Catnip on a soft, squishy surface. The air outside shimmered with a rainbow-like sheen, and strange, bioluminescent plants glowed in the dim light. Sir McGee, ever the brave explorer, donned his space helmet and beckoned Astro-Mouse to follow.

"Come on, don't be a scaredy-mouse!" he chuckled.

Astro-Mouse, clutching his wrench for dear life, scurried behind. As they ventured deeper, they noticed puddles of shimmering goo everywhere. It pulsed with a soft light, and strange symbols seemed to float within it.

Suddenly, one of the puddles rose up, forming a large, wobbly shape. Two large, friendly eyes blinked at them.

"Greetings, travelers!" a cheerful voice echoed in their helmets. "I am Gloop, guardian of Xylo."

Sir McGee stared, his jaw dropping beneath his helmet. "A… a talking amoeba?"

Gloop chuckled, the sound like bubbles popping. "Indeed! We are the Gloops, a peaceful race of… well, we are goo. But friendly goo!"

Astro-Mouse peeked out from behind Sir McGee. "Friendly goo? Are you… are you going to eat us?"

"Eat you? Goodness, no!" Gloop exclaimed. "We are herbivores. We eat space algae and stardust. Would you like some?"

Sir McGee, always up for a new culinary experience, nodded. Gloop extended a pseudopod and offered them a shimmering ball of light. It tasted like a mixture of cotton candy and electricity.

"Delicious!" Sir McGee purred. "So, Gloop, tell us about Xylo."

Gloop explained that Xylo was a living planet, and the Gloops were its caretakers. They maintained the planet's ecosystem and protected it from harm. He also told them about a hidden grove where the most delicious space berries grew.

Sir McGee' ears perked up. "Space berries, you say? Lead the way!"
