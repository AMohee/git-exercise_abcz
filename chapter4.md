# Chapter 4: I HOPE HE DIES IN CHAPTER 5 ON GOD

"We did it!" Astro-Mouse cheered, panting.

Captain Whiskers nodded, his fur slightly singed. "We make a pretty good team, you know?"

Gloop wobbled over to them, his eyes filled with gratitude. "Thank you, brave travelers. You have saved Xylo."

Captain Whiskers smiled. "It was our pleasure, Gloop. But we should probably get going now. We have a lot of space tuna to eat."

Astro-Mouse, finally relaxed, smiled. "I don't know, Captain. But as long as I have my wrench and you have your laser pointer, I think we can handle anything."

Astro-Mouse, finally relaxed, smiled. "I don't know, Captain. But as long as I have my wrench and you have your laser pointer, I think we can handle anything."

And so, the Cosmic Catnip continued its journey through the stars, carrying a brave cat, a resourceful mouse, and a bag full of delicious, glowing space berries. The universe was vast, and full of mysteries, but Captain Whiskers and Astro-Mouse were ready to face them all, one adventure at a time.
