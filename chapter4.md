# Chapter 4

"We did it!" Astro-Mouse cheered, panting.

Sir McGee nodded, his fur slightly singed. "We make a pretty good team, you know?"

Gloop wobbled over to them, his eyes filled with gratitude. "Thank you, brave travelers. You have saved Xylo."

Sir McGee smiled. "It was our pleasure, Gloop. But we should probably get going now. We have a lot of space tuna to eat."

They said goodbye to Gloop and the Gloops, promising to visit again soon. As Cosmic Catnip soared back into space, Sir McGee looked back at Planet Xylo, a small, glowing orb in the distance.

"Another adventure completed," he purred. "And who knows what other strange creatures and delicious space berries await us?"

Astro-Mouse, finally relaxed, smiled. "I don't know, Captain. But as long as I have my wrench and you have your laser pointer, I think we can handle anything."

And so, the Cosmic Catnip continued its journey through the stars, carrying a brave cat, a resourceful mouse, and a bag full of delicious, glowing space berries. The universe was vast, and full of mysteries, but Sir McGee and Astro-Mouse were ready to face them all, one adventure at a time.
