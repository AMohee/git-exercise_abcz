# Chapter 1: KILLED HALF THE PLANET'S WATER SUPPLY FOR THIS SHIT WILTED ROSE EMOJI

Sir McGee: A brave and curious cat astronaut.
Astro-Mouse: A small, nervous mouse who is the ship's engineer.
Gloop: A friendly, amoebic alien creature.

Sir McGee, a ginger tabby with eyes full of stardust, gazed out of the spaceship window. "Another day, another galaxy," he purred, his tail swishing with excitement. Beside him, Astro-Mouse, a tiny mouse with spectacles perched on his nose, trembled slightly.

"Are you sure about this, Captain?" Astro-Mouse squeaked. "Going this far into uncharted space… it feels risky."

"Nonsense, Astro-Mouse!" Sir McGee declared, puffing out his chest. "Adventure awaits! Besides, someone needs to discover new planets and bring back the finest space tuna."

Their ship, the 'Cosmic Catnip', was a marvel of feline engineering. It had scratching posts, laser pointers for entertainment, and a state-of-the-art tuna dispenser. After months of traveling, they had finally reached a nebula swirling with colors unknown to Earth.

Captain Whiskers grinned. "Goo, you say? Sounds like a purr-fect place to explore!"
"Approaching Planet Xylo," Astro-Mouse announced, his voice still a bit shaky. "Readings show a strange energy signature and… and lots of goo."

Sir McGee grinned. "Goo, you say? Sounds like a purr-fect place to explore!"
